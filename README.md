# BlockPuzzle-for-Desktop
This is my try of rebuilding popular game ,which is called 1010 or Block Pazzle Mania, but for desktop. Written in JavaFX.

In order to run this game, you need to install JDK12 and JavaFX12 lib on your computer. 
Then hust run Main class. And you can enjoy playing)(Maybe not).

There is still some bugs. So if you find one, request it :).
